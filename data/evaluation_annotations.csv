    # Steph Curry scored a total of 36 points.
    total_points = 36
    # Let's assume he made 'x' shots of each type.
    # Since each 2-point shot gives him 2 points and each 3-point shot gives him 3 points,
    # the equation representing the situation will be 2x + 3x = 36.
    # Solving for 'x' would give us the number of shots of each type he made.
    # Simplifying the equation gives us 5x = 36.
    # Dividing both sides by 5 gives us x = 36 / 5.

    # a common multiple of 10 points (2 shots * 2 points + 1 shot * 3 points),
    # we find how many times 10 goes into 36 to give us how many cycles of shots he made.
